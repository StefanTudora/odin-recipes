            <li>1 cup plain whole-milk yogurt</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger</li>
            <li>1 (8-ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons garam masala</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Chopped fresh cilantro for garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine yogurt, lemon juice, cumin, coriander, cayenne, black pepper, and salt. Add chicken pieces and stir to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or overnight for best results.</li>
            <li>Preheat your grill or broiler to high heat. Thread the chicken pieces onto skewers (if using wooden skewers, soak them in water for 30 minutes beforehand to prevent burning). Grill or broil the chicken for about 5-7 minutes on each side, until cooked through and slightly charred. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet or saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Add chopped onion and cook until softened and golden brown, about 5-7 minutes. Add minced garlic and grated ginger, and cook for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add tomato sauce to the skillet and stir well to combine with the onion mixture. Cook for about 10 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken slightly.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to low and stir in heavy cream, garam masala, turmeric, and chili powder. Simmer the sauce for another 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Add the grilled chicken pieces to the sauce and stir to coat them evenly. Simmer for an additional 5 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
            <li>Garnish with chopped fresh cilantro before serving. Serve hot with steamed basmati rice or naan bread.</li>
        </ol>
