        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3/4 cup buttermilk</li>
            <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons melted butter, plus more for cooking</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
            <li>In another bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
            <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; a few lumps are okay.</li>
            <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease it with butter.</li>
            <li>Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Flip the pancakes and cook for another 1-2 minutes until golden brown and cooked through.</li>
            <li>Remove from the skillet and keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, greasing the skillet as needed.</li>
            <li>Serve the pancakes warm with your favorite toppings such as maple syrup, fresh berries, or whipped cream.</li>
        </ol>
